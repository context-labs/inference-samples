Example code and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the Inference.net API. To run these examples, you'll need an Inference.net account and associated API key (create a free account here). Set an environment variable called INFERENCE_API_KEY with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an .env file at the root of your repo containing INFERENCE_API_KEY=<your API key>, which will be picked up by the notebooks.

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
